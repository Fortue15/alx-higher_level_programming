0x01-python-if else loops functions

0 - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
1 - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
2 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
4 - Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)

14 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
15 - Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).
